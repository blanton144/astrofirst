This repository has some material for initial exercises for students
starting to perform astrophysics research, and some example material.

1. Create your own GitHub repository that mirrors the structure of
this one. You will have to:

 * Create an account on GitHub
 * Create a repository with an informative name related to your project.
 * Clone the repository to your local machine (use 'git clone')
 * Create a directory structure in your working copy mirroring this product's
 * Copy the README files from the directories.
 * Commit the changes (use 'git commit')
 * Push the changes back to GitHub (use 'git push')

2. Find, read in, and plot information in an astronomical data file,
within the Jupyter environment. You will use data from the MaNGA
survey.  Figuring out how to do the tasks below will require reading
fairly extensively in the documentation.

 * Read the basic description of MaNGA (note the availability of the technical papers there): https://www.sdss4.org/surveys/manga/
 * Read the description of the catalogs for the survey: https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/manga/manga-data/catalogs/
 * Retrieve the DRPAll file for DR17, and plot the log of the stellar mass versus the redshift. Please:
   - Use the ELPETRO version of the mass
   - Color the points depending on whether they are Primary, Primary+, Secondary, or Ancillary. You will need to read the documentation to figure out how to do this!
   - Label the figure properly with units!
   - Write out the figure as a PNG file.

3. Now you should have a Jupyter notebook which solves the above
problem. Converty this into a Python script that you can run
independently of a Jupyter notebook.
