This repository has some material for initial exercises for students
starting to perform astrophysics research, and some example material.

Your first exercise will be to create your own GitHub repository that
mirrors the structure of this one. You will have to:

 * Create an account
 * Create a repository
 * Clone the repository to your local machine
